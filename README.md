# Eco Data
## Visualisations of global environmental data

### Working with the app

Within the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run api`

Runs a mock api that serves up static json.
It will show the available mock api endpoints in it's startup output.

You then need to leave the api running and start the app in a different terminal window.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
